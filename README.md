## option 1

   * Dean Gouramanis has done a much better job 
   * unforunately, nothing to mount pcb against front panel
   
## option 2

   * Based on the work above - I've extended the female board with 4 M2.5 mounting holes

## why
I have a micro-controller mounted behind a front panel. The sd-card reader is fixed to the micro-controller board and is unaccessable to the user. I'd like to allow the user to access the sd-card reader via the front panel. 

I didn't have much success looking for panel mount sd-card extenders unfortunately. There does seems to be a micro-sd extender commonly available, but it doesnt seem to have any way to mount it at a right-angle on the front-panel.
